            Kitty Coleman Woodland Gardens are an act of love, developed by one
            man in an effort to fulfill a dream to share with all. Bryan
            Zimmerman's Xmas Tree Farm and Santa's Barn are well-known in the
            Comox Valley during the winter months. He always knew he lived in a
            beautiful spot but it wasn't until he began clearing out some of the
            thick brush on his 24 acres of forested land that he thought of a
            way to share it with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Studying the interesting topography and unique layout gave him the
            idea for creating the woodland gardens. Over the next two years he
            began to build his wonderland dream clearing the underbrush by hand
            to reveal a forest floor more beautiful than he had imagined.

            Day by day, using his back and wheelbarrow, he laid over a mile of
            bark mulch paths meandering through the woods. Unwilling to disturb
            plant and tree root systems more than absolutely necessary or to use
            heavy equipment which would destroy the landscape, he dragged all
            brush and debris out manually.

            The beauty of the gardens is that most of the forests natural finery
            has been left alone, embellished, but not overwhelmed by
            cultivation. The gardens are especially designed to showcase the
            most beautiful of all shrubs: the rhododendron. Bryan has planted
            over 3000 rhododendrons of different varieties and sizes as well as
            companion plants and cultivated trees, all blending into the
            breathtakingly beautiful natural surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            To take a walk through this woodland garden gives one a feeling of
            peace and well-being. In the upper area he's used the land contours
            to his advantage in the placing of several ponds. The serenity draws
            one to follow the soft cedar bark paths, and the enticing trails
            that disappear into the woodlands. Granite rocks from the valley
            mountains line the pathways. The filtered sunlight, sparkling
            through the trees in an endless array of patterns lift your spirits.
            You inhale the sensual earthiness.

            The placement of a rustic hand-built bench here and there adds charm
            as well as providing the visitor with an opportunity to sit,
            meditate and listen to the birds. In the background, Kitty Coleman
            Creek babbles fluidly on its winding way down to the Georgia Strait.
            A Polynesian-style gazebo built from tree poles provides a sheltered
            place to sit and ponder, watch the great blue heron fly overhead,
            observe the birds at the feeders which are suspended around the
            gazebo, or even listen to the sea lions barking from the mouth of
            the creek a few hundred yards away. Licorice, deer, lady and sword
            ferns all proliferate, blending the wild with the cultivated.
            Looking closely, visitors will observe smaller natural flora such as
            sweet boxwood, broad-leaf starflower, fawn lily, Oregon grape,
            vanilla leaf and bleeding hearts on the forest floor.

            In the lower, or hidden garden, woodland paths descend to travel
            along Kitty Coleman Creek, where a pair of wood ducks happily
            meander. The view of the creek through filtered light and
            overhanging trees is one that inspired a group of artists to ask
            permission to paint there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, larger rhododendrons have been placed informally along the
            natural slope, giving the wanderer a surprising burst of colour. The
            idea is that anyone visiting will never see the same scenes twice.
            The rhododendrons bloom mainly from March to the end of June. Their
            dark green foliage is so attractive year round that they are one of
            British Columbia's favorite shrubs.

# Project Summary: Redesign of Woodland Gardens Website
Chosen Website: [Woodland Gardens](https://woodlandgardens.ca/)

## Why the Client Needs a New Website?

The current website for Woodland Gardens needs a redesign to better fulfill its purpose of inviting and informing potential visitors. Key issues include:

1. Accessibility: The site does not fully meet web accessibility standards, potentially excluding some visitors.
2. Outdated Design: The design is outdated and doesn’t effectively showcase the garden’s beauty.
3. Content Organization: The site is text-heavy, and information is not well organized for easy browsing.
Website Purpose

**The primary purpose** of this website is to attract visitors to Woodland Gardens by showcasing its beauty, serenity, and seasonal events. It should serve as a source of inspiration and information, enabling visitors to learn about the garden’s history, what to expect, and how to plan a visit.

**Target Audience**

1. Nature and Garden Enthusiasts looking for a peaceful environment to explore.
2. Families and Individuals planning local or tourist activities in the Comox Valley area.
3. Artists and Photographers seeking scenic, natural backdrops.
4. Event Planners interested in outdoor venues.
   
**Overall Message and Desired Actions**

The redesigned website should convey a sense of tranquility, natural beauty, and the uniqueness of Woodland Gardens. Key actions for visitors before they leave the site include:

1. Planning a Visit: Accessing hours, admission details, and directions.
2. Learning about Upcoming Events: Finding information on seasonal activities like the Christmas Tree Farm.
3. Booking an Inquiry: Using a web form to inquire about hosting events or planning a visit.

**Why the Current Site is Inappropriate**

The current site’s primary drawbacks are accessibility, design, and content organization. Its outdated aesthetic doesn’t reflect the peaceful, inviting atmosphere of Woodland Gardens, and the dense information layout makes it hard for users to quickly find key details. A redesign will enhance the user experience by improving site accessibility and creating a visually appealing presentation that encourages visitors to connect with the gardens.

## Look and Feel
**Mood**
The redesigned Woodland Gardens website will convey a serene, natural, and inviting mood. The design should feel warm, welcoming, and organic, reflecting the natural aesthetic of Woodland Gardens.

**Inspiration**
1. ### [Longwood Gardens](https://longwoodgardens.org/)

**Reason for Inspiration:** 

The Longwood Gardens website uses beautiful full-screen imagery and a minimalist design that emphasizes natural textures and colors. It has a calm and inviting feel, ideal for conveying the peaceful, immersive experience of a large garden.

2. ### [Butchart Gardens](https://www.butchartgardens.com/#0)

**Reason for Inspiration:**

The Butchart Gardens site effectively balances text and images, using clean layouts and warm tones to create a welcoming and serene atmosphere. It captures a similar natural and inviting aesthetic, ideal for Woodland Gardens.
### Colours
Based on the natural theme and existing visuals, the redesigned website will feature a calm and organic color palette:

1. Primary Color: Forest Green (#2F4F2F) – Represents the lush greenery of the gardens.
2. Neutral Color: Soft Beige (#F5F5DC) – Provides a clean, natural background that complements garden imagery.
3. Highlight Color: Muted Earthy Orange (#D99152) – Adds warmth and serves as an accent for calls to action.
